# Material for HPC Services Lawrencium Supercluster training held on 25st April 2024
This virtual training familarizes users with the new Rocky-8 operating system environment. The Rocky-8 testbed has been made available to users on CPU and GPU partitions so that users can compile and test their codes or use the existing applications for their scientific workflow. This is a great opportunity to learn about the new OS environment and ask questions so you are prepared for the upcoming system-wide OS migration which will happen on June 27th 2024. Rocky-8 documentation is available [here](https://it.lbl.gov/resource/hpc/for-users/hpc-documentation/rocky8/).
